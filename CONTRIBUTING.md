## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Stratus!
We've got some guidelines to help ensure that anyone wishing to contribute can do so in a consistent way, which makes things easier for everyone. Those guidelines are documented here!

## Getting Started

This project follows the [GitHub Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
In general, following the steps below will be the best approach:

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/rossja/stratus/issues). This will let us work through how the issue will be addressed on that thread.
2. Assign yourself to the issue
3. Create a branch using the following naming convention:
    * If it's a feature: `feature/issuenumber-descriptive-name` 
    * If it's a bug fix: `bugfix/issuenumber-descriptive-name` 
    * If it's a hot fix: `hotfix/issuenumber-descriptive-name` 
4. Add your code
6. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) against `dev`
7. Wait for the PR to be reviewed
8. Address any comments or questions added to the PR
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 until the PR is approved
10. Someone will then merge the PR into `main`

## Reporting A Bug

When creating an issue, please make sure to answer these questions:

1. What did you do?
2. What did you expect to see?
3. What did you see instead?

## Suggesting New Features

If you've got a suggestion for a new feature, that is great! Open an [issue](https://github.com/rossja/stratus/issues) to describe what you'd like to see added, why you think it would be useful for the project, and how you think it could work.

## Code review process

Pull requests (and issues) are regularly reviewed. If you've not heard back from someone in 3 business days, please reach out to [rossja](mailto:algorythm@gmail.com) directly.
